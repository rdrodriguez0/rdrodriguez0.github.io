# About Me
## My Interest
- **Family** - I enjoy spending time with family (Daughter and Girlfriend), we try to watch a movie together or play some type of board games/games such as: *Clue, Shenanigrams, SkipBo, Phase 10, Farkle, and Sorry*
- **Gaming** - I used to play console (PS5), but I recently switched to playing on PC, waiting to try the new _**Elden Ring**: _Nightreign_
- **Hiking** - Although, I haven't done much since I have moved here nor is there much around outside of trails, I do enjoy both.
- **Anime** - *YEP!* I watch a lot of anime, too many to list, but here are a few that you may know: _**Naruto: Shippuden, DBZ, Full Metal, Bleach, and Death Note**_
- **Going to the movies (AMC)** - *Who doesn't like a movie in the theater?* I have the AMC pass, which is about **30/month**, seems like a lot, but worth it if you go often as you can go 3 times a week.
## Websites I Recommend
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) is a site for videos. These videos range from how-to videos, clips from things that have been aired on TV, movie trailers, and a lot of creative content.
- [CrunchyRoll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) is an anime website where you can stream a ton of anime.
