# About Me
>“_Keep Going, Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end_.” **Roy T. Bennett**

After navigating this thing we call life for some time, I've recently decided it is never too late. I have been static in my IT career as it was rather comfortable. Working the basic "*Help Desk Support*" job for some years. Now that I have finally signed up for school and enrolled in several courses, I look forward to embarking. This will be a challenging chapter, but I am here for it and look forward to it all. I enjoy living a healthy lifestyle with working out and eating pretty healthy, although I am a foodie and love eating. I try to be as optimistic as possible and do everything with a smile. **KEEP GOING!**

## My Interest
* **Family** - I enjoy spending time with family (Daughter and Girlfriend), we try to watch a movie together or play some type of board games/games such as: *Clue, Shenanigrams, SkipBo, Phase 10, Farkle, and Sorry*
* **Gaming** - I used to play console (PS5), but I recently switched to playing on PC, waiting to try the new _**Elden Ring: Nightreign**_
* **Hiking** - Although, I haven't done much since I have moved here nor is there much around outside of trails, I do enjoy both.
* **Anime** - *YEP!* I watch a lot of anime, too many to list, but here are a few that you may know: _**Naruto: Shippuden, DBZ, Full Metal, Bleach, and Death Note**_
* **Going to the movies (AMC)** - *Who doesn't like a movie in the theater?* I have the AMC pass, which is about **30/month**, seems like a lot, but worth it if you go often, as you can go 3 times a week.
## Websites I Recommend
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) is a site for videos. These videos range from how-to videos, clips from things that have been aired on TV, movie trailers, and a lot of creative content.
* [CrunchyRoll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) is an anime website where you can stream a ton of anime.
